The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks. The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger **survived (1) or not (0)** based on different factors.

### 🎯 Key Objectives:
- Perform **data preprocessing** and **feature engineering**.
- Train and evaluate **machine learning models** for binary classification.
- Compare different models and optimize performance.
- Visualize key insights from the dataset.
